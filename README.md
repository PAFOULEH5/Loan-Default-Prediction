## Project Overview

The **Loan Default Prediction** project aims to help financial institutions assess the risk of loan defaults. By analyzing various factors, including credit scores and financial history, we built a machine learning model that can predict whether a borrower is likely to default on a loan. This project is particularly relevant in todayâ€™s financial landscape, where understanding risk is crucial for both lenders and borrowers.

## Technologies Used

This project employs several technologies and methodologies, including:

- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **SMOTE**: For handling imbalanced data.
- **Logistic Regression**: The main algorithm used for classification.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced visualizations.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PAFOULEH5/Loan-Default-Prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Loan-Default-Prediction
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data

The dataset used in this project consists of various features related to borrowers' financial history. Key features include:

- Credit Score
- Loan Amount
- Income
- Employment Status
- Previous Defaults

The data was sourced from publicly available datasets and preprocessed to ensure quality and relevance. 

## Model Development

The model development process involved several key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: This included handling missing values, normalizing data, and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We visualized the data to understand relationships and distributions.

3. **Model Training**: We implemented logistic regression as our primary classification algorithm. 

4. **Handling Imbalanced Data**: We used SMOTE to generate synthetic samples for the minority class, improving model performance.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: We optimized the model's parameters to enhance accuracy.

## Evaluation

The model's performance was evaluated using several metrics:

- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly predicted instances.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the model's effectiveness in predicting loan defaults.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PAFOULEH5/Loan-Default-Prediction.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Loan-Default-Prediction
   ```
4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the model for predictions, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your input data in the required format.
2. Load the trained model.
3. Use the model to make predictions.

Example code for making predictions:

```python
import joblib

# Load the model
model = joblib.load('loan_default_model.pkl')

# Prepare your input data
input_data = [[credit_score, loan_amount, income, employment_status, previous_defaults]]

# Make predictions
prediction = model.predict(input_data)
print("Loan Default Prediction:", prediction)
```
